Task: Extend the existing OmniHive Admin View by adding the ability to create an Overall LLM Agent (Orchestrator). This agent will ingest business-wide documents, detect contact intent, and route contacts to the correct topic-specific AI agent.

🔐 Access Control

This feature is available only in Admin View.

Existing Agent View and Supervisor View remain unchanged.

⚙️ Admin Workflow
1. Upload Generic Business Documents

Allow admins to upload multiple files (PDF, DOCX, TXT).

Store uploaded documents securely and embed into a vector database for retrieval.

Display uploaded documents in a list with:

File name

Upload date

Option to delete or replace

2. Create Overall LLM Agent

Add a new section under Admin Dashboard: “Overall LLM Agent”.

Configurable fields:

Agent Name (default: “OmniHive Orchestrator”).

Instruction Set (text area where admin can define global rules, e.g., “Always comply with refund policies first”).

Knowledge Source (list of uploaded business documents).

Save this profile so it becomes the default orchestrator.

3. Intent Detection & Routing

When analyzing a contact:

The Overall LLM Agent scans the interaction transcript.

Detects intent/topic (e.g., refund, cancellation, billing).

Routes the contact to the correct specialized AI agent already configured for that intent.

If no match is found → provide fallback analysis using generic orchestrator knowledge.

4. Orchestrator Dashboard

Show routing analytics:

% of contacts routed to each topic-specific AI agent.

% of fallback cases (no matching agent).

Show intent distribution trends over time (bar chart or pie chart).

Show training status of orchestrator (last updated, number of docs loaded).

🎨 UX/UI Guidelines

Place “Overall LLM Agent” tab in Admin navigation sidebar.

UI layout:

Top section → Create/Edit Overall Agent (name, rules, docs).

Middle section → Uploaded documents list.

Bottom section → Routing analytics + charts.

Match design style of existing OmniHive dashboards (cards, rounded edges, light blue theme).

✅ Expected Output

Admins can upload business-wide documents.

Admins can configure and save an Overall LLM Orchestrator Agent.

Contacts are first processed by orchestrator → routed to correct specialized agent.

Fallback coaching is available when no specific agent matches.

Orchestrator dashboard shows document list, routing analytics, and intent distribution.
