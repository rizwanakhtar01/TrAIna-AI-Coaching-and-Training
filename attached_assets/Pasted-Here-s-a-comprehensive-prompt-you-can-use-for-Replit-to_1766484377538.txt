Here's a comprehensive prompt you can use for Replit to add the bulk import feature to your existing user management system:

---

**Prompt for Replit:**

Add a bulk user import feature to the existing user management system. Here are the requirements:

**1. UI Changes:**
- Add an "Import Users" button next to the existing "Create New User" button in the user management header
- The button should have an upload icon and open a modal when clicked

**2. Import Modal (Step 1 - Upload):**
- Create a modal with the title "Import Users" and subtitle "Upload a CSV file to add multiple users at once"
- Include two steps:
  - Step 1: "Download CSV Template" - Add a button to download a sample CSV template file
  - Step 2: "Upload Your File" - Add a file upload area with drag-and-drop support that accepts only .csv files (max 5MB)
- The CSV template should include columns: Full Name, Email, Role, Amazon Connect User ID
- Required fields: Full Name, Email, Role
- Optional fields: Amazon Connect User ID

**3. Validation Screen:**
- After file upload, parse and validate the CSV data
- Show validation results with:
  - Summary cards showing count of Valid users (green), Warnings (yellow), and Errors (red)
  - List of specific issues found with row number, field name, and error message
  - Validation rules:
    * Email must be valid format and unique
    * Full Name is required
    * Role must be one of: Agent, Supervisor, Admin
    * Flag warnings for missing optional fields
- Add a note: "Users with errors will be skipped. Users with warnings will be imported with default values."
- Show "Back" button and "Import X Users" button (disabled if errors exist)

**4. Success Confirmation:**
- Show success modal with checkmark icon
- Display message: "X users have been successfully imported to the platform"
- "Done" button to close and refresh the user list

**5. Technical Requirements:**
- Use the same styling and components as the existing user management interface
- Integrate with existing user creation API/database functions
- Handle CSV parsing on the backend
- Validate data before insertion
- Return detailed validation results to frontend
- Bulk insert valid users into the database
- Maintain existing user table functionality

**6. Error Handling:**
- Show appropriate error messages for file upload failures
- Handle CSV parsing errors gracefully
- Validate file size and format before processing
- Show user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios

Please implement this feature maintaining consistency with the existing design system and user management functionality.
