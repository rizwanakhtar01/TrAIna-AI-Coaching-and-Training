Enhance the existing **Business Documents** section under **Overall LLM Agent** to support **Topic-Based Knowledge Bases**.

⚠️ Constraints:

* UI-only implementation
* No backend logic or persistence required
* Do NOT break or remove the existing Business Documents capability
* Use mock data where needed

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Allow Admins to organize business documents into **topic-specific knowledge bases** (e.g., Sales, Billing, Support) so these can later be assigned to specific teams or AI agents.

---

## 🧭 **UI Enhancements**

### **1. Knowledge Base List View**

Replace or extend the current Business Documents section with a **Knowledge Bases** view showing a list of KBs.

Each Knowledge Base card/list item should display:

* Knowledge Base Name (e.g., Sales, Refunds, Technical Support)
* Short description
* Number of documents uploaded
* Actions: View / Edit / Delete

Use mock KBs like:

* Sales
* Billing & Refunds
* Account Management

---

### **2. Create Knowledge Base**

Add a **“Create Knowledge Base”** button.

On click, show a modal or page with:

* Knowledge Base Name (required)
* Description (optional)
* Intended Use (helper text, e.g., “Used for sales-related queries”)

On save:

* Add the KB to the list view (mock only)

---

### **3. Knowledge Base Detail View**

When clicking **View** on a KB:

* Show KB name and description
* Show an **Upload Documents** section scoped to this KB
* Support uploading PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
* Display a list of uploaded documents with:

  * File name
  * Upload date
  * Delete action (UI only)

This replaces the idea of one global document bucket with **KB-scoped uploads**.

---

### **4. UX & Copy Guidance**

* Clearly communicate that:

  > “Knowledge Bases help organize documents by topic and can be assigned to teams or AI agents.”
* Maintain the same visual style as the existing Business Documents section.

---

## 📦 **Out of Scope (Do NOT Implement)**

* Team assignment logic
* AI agent binding
* Document processing or embeddings
* Backend storage

This is strictly a UI + structural enhancement.
