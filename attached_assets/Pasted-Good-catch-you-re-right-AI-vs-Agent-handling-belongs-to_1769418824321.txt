Good catch 👍 — you’re right. **AI vs Agent handling** belongs to OmniHive, not OmniTrAina.

Below is the **corrected Phase 1 Replit prompt**, with that metric **removed and replaced** by metrics that *do* make sense for OmniTrAina (onboarding + training readiness).


**PROMPT START**

You are extending the existing **OmniTrAina** application by adding a **Super Admin Dashboard – Phase 1 only**.

⚠️ Constraints:

* Do NOT modify any existing customer-facing dashboards (Admin, Supervisor, Agent).
* UI-only implementation.
* No backend logic or APIs.
* Use mock / placeholder data.

---

## 🧭 **1. Super Admin Entry & Layout**

* Add a dedicated **Super Admin** route/view.
* Use a sidebar-based layout consistent with the rest of the app.
* Clearly label this area as **“Super Admin – OmniTrAina”**.

---

## 🏢 **2. Customer (Tenant) Management**

### **Customers List Page**

Create a primary section called **Customers** with a table showing:

Columns:

* Company Name
* Tenant ID (placeholder)
* Status (Active / Inactive)
* Enabled Modules (Training, AI Coaching, Knowledge Base)
* Actions: View / Edit / Suspend

Populate with realistic mock data.

---

### **Create Customer Flow (UI Only)**

Add a **“Create Customer”** button.

Form fields:

* Company Name
* Primary Admin Email
* Region (dropdown)
* Enabled Modules (checkboxes):

  * Agent Training
  * AI Coaching
  * Knowledge Base

On submit:

* Show success confirmation
* Return to Customers List

---

### **Customer Profile View (Read-Only)**

When clicking **View**, show:

* Company Name
* Tenant ID
* Status
* Enabled Modules

**Onboarding Readiness Checklist (visual only):**

* Admin created
* Knowledge base uploaded
* Training content added
* Agents onboarded
* First training session completed

(No contact handling metrics.)

---

## 📊 **3. Platform Overview (Relevant to OmniTrAina)**

Create a **Dashboard / Overview** page with cards showing:

* Total Customers
* Total Agents Onboarded (across tenants)
* Total Training Modules Created
* % Customers with KB Uploaded
* % Customers with Active Training Programs

Use static placeholder numbers.

---

## 🔐 **4. Access & Roles (Informational Only)**

Create a section **Access & Roles**:

* Describe Super Admin role
* Show example list of Customer Admins (read-only)

No editing or permissions management required.

---

## 🎨 **5. Design Guidelines**

* Match existing OmniTrAina visual style
* Clean, enterprise-focused UI
* Desktop-first layout
* Simple tables, cards, and forms

---

## 🧪 **6. Demo Data**

Use sample customers:

* Acme Corp
* Nova Support
* ZenRetail

Each with different onboarding states to demonstrate the readiness checklist.
