Task: Enhance the Omningage Agent Desktop by adding a floating AI Coaching widget that appears whenever an agent logs in.

🔐 Login Page Update

On the existing Login Page, add a new link/button labeled "Agent Desktop" on the top right corner.

When clicked, redirect to the Agent Desktop view (use the attached screenshot as the main background layout).

🎯 Floating Widget Specifications
Placement & Behavior

Floating widget should pop up automatically once the agent logs into Omningage.

Position: bottom-right corner of the Agent Desktop screen.

Style: Rounded card with subtle shadow, minimal design to avoid blocking key dashboard metrics.

Collapsible: Add an expand/collapse button so agents can hide or reopen it.

Content (Daily Coaching Snapshot)

Greeting

Personalized text:
"Hey [Agent Name], Good day!"

Fetch agent’s name from login session.

Yesterday’s Performance Overview

Show 3–4 short sections in bullet or card format:

Areas where agent struggled the most (e.g., empathy, product policy explanation).

Contact references where issues occurred (show 2–3 recent contact IDs with links to full review).

Areas to focus on today (highlight skills to improve).

Tips for improvement (AI-generated actionable coaching tip).

CTA Button

“See Details” button at the bottom.

On click → Redirect agent to the full Agent View (AI Coaching module) for detailed analysis.

🎨 UX/UI Guidelines

Use the attached Agent Desktop screenshot as the page background (simulate realistic integration).

Widget dimensions: ~350px width, auto height based on content.

Colors: match Omningage’s branding (light blue/white with accent highlights).

Typography consistent with current dashboard.

Widget greets agent by name and shows yesterday’s performance summary.
